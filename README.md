# previous readme notes
- public only chats - don't owrry about privacy
- able to link messages and share them on twitter
- link goes to conversation
- link also shows preview incl image of the message

this borrows from the hablamos project found here - https://functional.works-hub.com/learn/lets-build-a-clojurescript-chatroom-570e9 as well as this tutorial - https://github.com/briangorman/hablamos. license for that project is found in the licenses folder of this one.

https://a9.io/glue-comic/ - chatting with glue - is another major inspiration here.


goal: the backend should be an element chatroom. that provides us a robust bust base and the flexibility to do what we want with the chat
we want to be able to allow random users to join this new element chatroom, but just a single channel; this should then interacti with our big website in some way,
and should be visible from both that site and the chatroom
this chat will eventually be a part of the home page with lots of cool thigns on it!
